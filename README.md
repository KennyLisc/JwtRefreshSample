# JwtRefreshSample
A sample project on how to refresh JWT token using ASP.NET Core 2.0 API.

This is adaptation project from the original project here: http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/handle-refresh-token-using-asp-net-core-2-0-and-json-web-token/. The original project was made using ASP.NET Core 2 Preview. There are some breaking changes that makes the original project cannot be compiled using RTM version. This adaptation project is targeted to ASP.NET Core 2.0 RTM version.

You have to use Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3.* (my version is 13.3.2), and also MAKE SURE to use latest minor version of C# in order to compile asynchronous Main() in Console application.
